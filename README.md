Automated Royalty Distribution System
Project Description
The Automated Royalty Distribution System is a blockchain-based solution built on Solidity that enables creators to automatically receive royalties whenever their digital assets are sold or used in secondary markets. By leveraging smart contracts, the system eliminates intermediaries, reduces payment delays, and ensures transparent and fair compensation for creators.
Project Vision
In today's digital economy, creators often struggle to track and receive fair compensation when their work is resold or reused. Our vision is to empower creators with a trustless, transparent system that guarantees they receive the royalties they deserve without relying on centralized platforms or complex legal agreements. We aim to build an ecosystem where creators can focus on their craft while their economic rights are automatically enforced through blockchain technology.
Key Features

Creator Registration - Artists and content creators can register on the platform with their wallet addresses, creating a verifiable digital identity.
Asset Registration - Creators can register their digital assets with customizable royalty percentages (up to 50%), linking each asset to their creator profile.
Automatic Royalty Distribution - When a registered asset is sold, the smart contract automatically calculates and distributes the appropriate royalty amount to the creator's wallet in real-time.
Asset Management - Creators can view all their registered assets and toggle their active status as needed.
Sale Tracking - The system records all sales transactions, providing creators with transparent data about when and how their assets are being used.
Customizable Royalty Rates - Creators can set different royalty percentages for each of their assets based on their preferences and market conditions.

Future Scope

Multi-Tier Royalty Structure - Implement support for multiple creators per asset with customizable royalty splits.
Time-Based Royalty Adjustments - Allow royalty percentages to dynamically change based on time passed or number of sales.
Integration with NFT Marketplaces - Develop plugins to integrate with popular NFT marketplaces for seamless royalty enforcement.
Cross-Chain Compatibility - Expand the system to work across multiple blockchain networks to maximize reach and accessibility.
DAO Governance - Implement a governance token system allowing stakeholders to participate in protocol decisions.
Analytics Dashboard - Create a comprehensive frontend interface with analytics tools for creators to track their earnings and asset performance.
Secondary Sales Detection - Develop mechanisms to detect and enforce royalties on secondary sales occurring outside integrated marketplaces.
Royalty Pools - Enable the creation of royalty pools where multiple contributors can receive proportional payouts.
